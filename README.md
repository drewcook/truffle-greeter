# Greeter Smart Contract Development

This is a repo for my source source code as I work through[this book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-smart-contract/9781492045250/).

This is a smart contract in Solidity built for the Ethereum networks that implements basic greeting type functionality.

This project is built with the [Truffle framework](https://trufflesuite.com/) for smart contract development, deploying, migrating, and testing.

## Dependencies

This project uses [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) as a source for smart contract inheritance and needs to be installed as a package with NPM.

```bash
npm install
```
