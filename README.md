# Solidity Smart Contract Development for Ethereum

This is a repo for my source source code as I work through [this book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-smart-contract/9781492045250/).

These projects are built with the [Truffle framework](https://trufflesuite.com/) for smart contract development, deploying, migrating, and testing.

## Dependencies

Some projects use dependencies, including [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) as a source for smart contract inheritance, and therefore would need to be installed prior to working with the project. Each project maintains their own `package.json` and dependencies.

Install them with NPM:

```bash
npm install
```
